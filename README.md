# Instant Face Unlock

Description:
Unlocks your phone as soon as face scan is complete

## Temporary Notice

Oreo Update: Although the current latest version says 'Oreo', it is actually not yet working on Oreo, and I'm reserving 1.3.X for internal test builds and the closed beta. When finished, verion 1.4 will be the official working version of Oreo. However, I've noticed some other issues with earlier versions (Marshmallow and Lollipop), so I will fix them first, and then finally release 1.4.1 on the Xposed repo. I will upload versions 1.3.X, 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 to the repo when they are completed, so you're welcome to download and compile these before I launch 1.4.1 to the general public. If you'd like to join the Oreo beta program, message me on XDA Forums. Thanks :)

## Installation

Use the repo found at: http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.samstenner.instantunlock

## Usage

Once installed, reboot. That's all!
Note: If the app installs to an SD Card, you need to move it to your internal storage, and THEN do a reboot.
